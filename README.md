# GitHub GraphQL API example

This demo app is a frontend for the GitHub GraphQL API. The frontend allows you to browse the issues of a GitHub repository, specifically of the official React repository. It is a Next.js app which allows users to search for a text term in either the body or title of the issues as well as for the status OPEN or CLOSED. After listing these issues, the user can view a single issue and all the comments.
